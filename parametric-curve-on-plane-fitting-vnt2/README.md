# Parametric curve on plane fitting (variant #2)
It is like previous project: same purpose and same command line interface. The difference is in the implementation: the previous project use one model with 2 output neurons, this one uses two different linear models trained separately.

```bash
$ cd parametric-curve-on-plane-fitting-vnt2/examples
$ bash example1.sh
```
